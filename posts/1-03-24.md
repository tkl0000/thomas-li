**New Years Resolutions**:

- Become closer with God / Read bible seriously
- Become kinder with myself
- Radiate Joy
- ~~Get into a good school~~
- Worry less about things out of my control
- Get a firm grasp of Abstract Algebra
- Get better at time management

It's kind of crazy that by this time next year I'll already be halfway through my first year in college. I'm certainly in a time of my life that feels very uncertain. I feel like especially in the past year I've being trying very hard to control the account of my life, and now I have to come to terms with the reality that things are out of my control.

I guess we'll see how everything plays out <3
